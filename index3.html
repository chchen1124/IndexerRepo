		<h1>The story of Tiger Slayer Wu Song</h1>
		<p>Wu Song was on his way back to Yanggu country to join his elder brother after an absence of many long years. There was only one more mountain, the Jingyang Ridge, to cross before he would be home. Stopping at a wine shop for a meal, he noticed a sign with the warning: "Three Bowls and You Cannot Top the Ridge."</p> 

		<p>Hungry and thirsty, he ordered meat and drink. After he had eaten a hearty meal and drunk three bowls of wine, the shop-keeper would not sell him any more, explaining to the annoyed customer that although a country brew, his vintage had the taste and potency of old wine; that's why it had acquired another name: "Wine That Knocks You Down outside the Door". At the insistence of Wu Song, whose thirst had just been whetted by the first three bowls, the shop-keeper had to serve another, and then another, until the hero had finished eighteen bowls of the potent booze, six times the limit!</p> 

		<p>He picked up his bundle to continue his journey, only to be stopped by the wine seller again with the warning that in recent months a tiger had been roaming the ridge and had taken the lives of around twenty people or so. The local magistrate, he said, had stipulated that passersby could only cross the ridge during the few hours before and after noontime, and must do so in large groups.</p> 

		<p>Wu Song took little notice of the warning and set out alone late in the afternoon, suspecting the shop-keeper of trying to get some extra business by making him spend the night at his inn. Halfway up the slope he came across an offical notice confirming what the shop-keeper had said, but he was reluctant to turn back now, for it was a question of saving face.</p> 

		<p id="tigerkilled">Heady with wine, he slumped down on a rock for a rest. In a flash, a slant-eyed, white-browed tiger burst out like a howling whirlwind. Ravenous, it sprang at Wu Song, who jumped aside to dodge it. Raising the club that he carried, he aimed a blow at it but missed, swinging the club onto a tree and breaking it in two. The ensuing life-and-death struggle lasted for some time. At length he managed to grasp the tiger by the scruff of the neck and press its head down. With all his might he kicked the beast in its face and eyes. The tiger set up a terrible roaring and pawed the ground beneath its body. The scraping and scuffling wore away the dirt, and Wu Song pressed its muzzle down into the pit. The tiger began to show hand, Wu Song clenched his right fist into a very hammer of iron and with all the strength he could muster he struck and struck again. After some fifty to seventy blows, blood flowed out from the great beast's eyes, mouth, nose and ears. That is how Wu Song killed the tiger with his bare hands.</p> 

		<p>Quickly the news spread and exhausted Wu Song was given a hero's welcome by the people of his native town.</p>
